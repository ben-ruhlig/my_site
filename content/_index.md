I'm a current student Computer & Information Technology student @[UPenn](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/).
I have an undergraduate degree in Accounting and am a licenced [CPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Public_Accountant).
I left my finance job to finish my master's degree, travel, and build things with technology.

I'll blog about my travels, technology, and anything else I find interesting.
